One little known fact is that students in the foster care system can attend any public university for free if they are accepted. I recently had to stop tutoring due to my clinical rotation out of state. Prior to our last session, Allyson shared with me that she thought sheâ€™d like to be a physical therapist and hoped our paths would cross again.
