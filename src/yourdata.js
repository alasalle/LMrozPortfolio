    "I’m Lacy Mroz. I’m a third year in Florida Gulf Coast University’s Doctor of Physical Therapy Program. Throughout this page, you’ll find some of my personal highlights, my achievements, and some of the relationships I’ve built throughout my academic career. None of that matters. None of it. All that matters is why. My why or, rather, whys are Tim, Adrienne, Sarah, Luke, and my colleagues who give their best each and every day. And finally, each and every one of my future patients who deserve a well-rounded, competent, and caring clinician who is just as passionate about their recovery as they are. You can find out more about them in these pages and take a look at everything else too!",

As with many students, I was inspired by her courage and resilience, despite the fact that these two qualities showed themselves in areas that weren’t exactly included in high school curriculums.  We got to work, figured out her learning style, and it wasn’t long before she was excelling in school. She began to think about college and we researched admission requirements together. One little known fact is that students in the foster care system can attend any public university for free if they are accepted. I recently had to stop tutoring due to my clinical rotation out of state. Prior to our last session, Adrienne shared with me that she thought she’d like to be a physical therapist and hoped our paths would cross again.

I attended Cole’s session at the beginning of my first year and became acutely aware of the discrimination trans* patients are faced within the healthcare system. Trans* healthcare is a touchy subject for many. I felt personally that all people should be treated with respect for their identities and with kindness. Until my third year, I did not have the courage to bring up this topic to my peers and colleagues. I broached the subject with some of my friends and they had varying responses. Some of them were unsure how to handle situations involving pronoun usage, others were dismissive of the concept of gender identity, others like me were concerned about mistreatment and the ethics surrounding trans* healthcare rights. I made the decision with my friends who shared the same concerns that it was our professional duty to present on trans* healthcare rights for our ethics class. I ran our presentation past the trans* educators I knew and we were able to advocate for patients who are transgender. We deferred to trans* authors and emphasized the APTA code of conduct."

In some ways, I have been critical of business owners, venture capitalism, and the like. I have yearned for change, for more community based solutions to problems, for models that valued people over profits. My professor, Dr. Black, shared with us some of the business plans he had and I was struck by the ways his businesses truly benefited the communities he was serving. Together, Kaylee and I got creative. We designed a plan that collaborated with community organizers, utilized innovative technology, leveled the playing field of wealth inequality, and invested into the same community we were serving."

Between her favorite “zero gravity position” and radiation fibrosis, she eventually developed hip flexion contractures that made it difficult for her to walk. And her fatigue was its own battle. I still have a voicemail saved on my phone that brought me to tears of both joy and pain. Lizzy and I had spent the afternoon together and she left me a voicemail thanking me, letting me know that the afternoon had been so great that “I don’t even need to take my nap!”"

When the opportunity came up, there was at least some part of me that felt guided. I’m a firm believer that those we love live on inside of us. People impact our lives and that impact remains whether they remain or not. In any case, I heard my friend with her usual encouragement, “Oh come on! Try your hand again!” And I made the decision to apply for a clinical at Moffitt despite my fears from earlier clinical experiences."
